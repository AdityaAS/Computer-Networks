So, I'm back! After the winter vacation. Semester started in January. Almost forgot that I had this going. Hopefully, I will continue the activity and hopefully something worthwhile will come out of this effort. Anyway, wishing myself best of luck.

I'm doing the Computer Networks Course this semester. Seems interesting, even the professor seems to be teaching well.

Will keep posting content as and when it is ready.
