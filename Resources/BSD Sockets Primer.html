As  you  delve into the mysteries of UNIX, you find more and more
things that are difficult  to  understand  immediately.   One  of
these  things,  at  least for most people, is the BSD socket concept. 
This is a short tutorial that explains what they are,  how
they work, and gives sample code showing how to use them.
<p>

<h2><a name="1" href="http://www.softlab.ntua.gr/facilities/documentation/unix/sockets.html#0">The Analogy</a>
<br>(or:  What *IS* a socket, anyway?)</h2>

The  <b>socket</b> is the BSD method for accomplishing interprocess
communication (IPC).  What this means is a socket is used  to  allow
one  process to speak to another, very much like the telephone is
used to allow one person to speak to another.
<p>
The telephone analogy is a very good one, and will  be  used 
repeatedly to describe socket behavior.
</p><p>
</p><hr>


<h2><a name="2" href="http://www.softlab.ntua.gr/facilities/documentation/unix/sockets.html#0">Installing Your New Phone</a>
<br>(or:  How to listen for socket connections)</h2>

In  order  for a person to receive telephone calls, he must first
have a telephone installed.  Likewise you must create a socket to
listen  for  connections.   This  process involves several steps.
First you must make a new socket, which is similar  to  having  a
telephone  line  installed.   The  <a href="http://www.softlab.ntua.gr/cgi-bin/man-cgi?socket+2"><b>socket()</b></a> command is used to do
this.
<p>
Since sockets can have several types, you must specify what  type
of socket you want when you create one.  One option that you have
is the addressing format of a socket.  Just as the  mail  service
uses a different scheme to deliver mail than the telephone company
uses to complete calls, so can sockets differ.  The  two  most
common  addressing  schemes are <b>AF_UNIX</b> and <b>AF_INET.</b>  AF_UNIX
addressing uses UNIX pathnames to identify sockets;  these  sockets
are  very  useful  for IPC between processes on the same machine.
AF_INET addressing uses Internet addresses which  are  four  byte
numbers  usually written as four decimal numbers separated by periods
(such as 192.9.200.10).  In addition  to  the  machine  ad dress, 
there  is  also  a port number which allows more than one
AF_INET socket on each machine.  AF_INET addresses  are  what  we
will deal with here.
</p><p>
Another  option  which  you must supply when creating a socket is
the type of socket.  The two most common  types  are  <b>SOCK_STREAM</b>
and <b>SOCK_DGRAM.</b>  SOCK_STREAM indicates that data will come across
the socket as a stream of characters, while SOCK_DGRAM  indicates
that  data  will  come in bunches (called datagrams).  We will be
dealing with SOCK_STREAM sockets, which are very common.
</p><p>
After creating a socket, we must give the socket  an  address  to
listen to, just as you get a telephone number so that you can
receive calls.  The <a href="http://www.softlab.ntua.gr/cgi-bin/man-cgi?bind+2"><b>bind()</b></a>
function is used to do this (it binds  a
socket to an address, hence the name).
</p><p>
SOCK_STREAM  type sockets have the ability to queue incoming connection
requests, which is a lot like having "call  waiting"  for
your  telephone.  If you are busy handling a connection, the connection
request will wait until you can deal with it.   The  <a href="http://www.softlab.ntua.gr/cgi-bin/man-cgi?listen+2"><b>listen()</b></a>  function
is used to set the maximum number of requests (up
to a maximum of five, usually) that will  be  queued  before  requests 
start being denied.  While it is not necessary to use the
listen() function, it's good practice.
</p><p>
The following function shows how to use the socket(), bind(), and
listen() functions to establish a socket which can accept calls:
</p><p>
</p><listing>  /* code to establish a socket; originally from bzs@bu-cs.bu.edu
   */

  int establish(portnum)
  u_short portnum;
  { char   myname[MAXHOSTNAME+1];
    int    s;
    struct sockaddr_in sa;
    struct hostent *hp;

    bzero(&amp;sa,sizeof(struct sockaddr_in));      /* clear our address */
    gethostname(myname,MAXHOSTNAME);            /* who are we? */
    hp= gethostbyname(myname);                  /* get our address info */
    if (hp == NULL)                             /* we don't exist !? */
      return(-1);
    sa.sin_family= hp-&gt;h_addrtype;              /* this is our host address */
    sa.sin_port= htons(portnum);                /* this is our port number */
    if ((s= socket(AF_INET,SOCK_STREAM,0)) &lt; 0) /* create socket */
      return(-1);
    if (bind(s,&amp;sa,sizeof sa,0) &lt; 0) {
      close(s);
      return(-1);                               /* bind address to socket */
    }
    listen(s, 3);                               /* max # of queued connects */
    return(s);
  }
</listing>
<p>
After  you  create a socket to get calls, you must wait for calls
to that socket.  The <a href="http://www.softlab.ntua.gr/cgi-bin/man-cgi?accept+2"><b>accept()</b></a> function is used to do this.  Calling 
accept()  is  analogous  to picking up the telephone if it's
ringing.  Accept() returns a new socket which is connected to the
caller.
</p><p>
The  following  function  can be used to accept a connection on a
socket that has  been  created  using  the  establish()  function
above:
</p><p>
</p><listing>  int get_connection(s)
  int s;                    /* socket created with establish() */
  { struct sockaddr_in isa; /* address of socket */
    int i;                  /* size of address */
    int t;                  /* socket of connection */

    i = sizeof(isa);                   /* find socket's address */
    getsockname(s,&amp;isa,&amp;i);            /* for accept() */

    if ((t = accept(s,&amp;isa,&amp;i)) &lt; 0)   /* accept connection if there is one */
      return(-1);
    return(t);
  }
</listing>
<p>
Unlike  with the telephone, you may still accept calls while processing
previous connections.  For this reason you  usually  fork
off jobs to handle each connection.  The following code shows how
to use establish() and get_connection() to allow multiple connections to
be dealt with:
</p><p>
</p><listing>  #include <errno.h>       /* obligatory includes */
  #include <signal.h>
  #include <stdio.h>
  #include <sys types.h="">
  #include <sys socket.h="">
  #include <sys wait.h="">
  #include <netinet in.h="">
  #include <netdb.h>

  #define PORTNUM 50000 /* random port number, we need something */

  void fireman(), do_something();

  main()
  { int s, t;

    if ((s= establish(PORTNUM)) &lt; 0) {  /* plug in the phone */
      perror("establish");
      exit(1);
    }

    signal(SIGCHLD, fireman);           /* this eliminates zombies */

    for (;;) {                          /* loop for phone calls */
      if ((t= get_connection(s)) &lt; 0) { /* get a connection */
        if (errno == EINTR)             /* EINTR might happen on accept(), */
          continue;                     /* try again */
        perror("accept");               /* bad */
        exit(1);
      }
      switch(fork()) {                  /* try to handle connection */
      case -1 :                         /* bad news.  scream and die */
        perror("fork");
        close(s);
        close(t);
        exit(1);
      case 0 :                          /* we're the child, do something */
        do_something(t);
        exit(0);
      default :                         /* we're the parent so look for */
        close(t);                       /* another connection */
        continue;
      }
    }
  }

  /* as children die we should get catch their returns or else we get
   * zombies, A Bad Thing.  fireman() catches falling children.
   */

  void fireman()
  { union wait wstatus;

    while(wait3(&amp;wstatus,WNOHANG,NULL) &gt; 0)
     ;
  }

  /* this is the function that plays with the socket.  it will be called
   * after getting a connection.
   */

  void do_something(s)
  int s;
  {
    /* do your thing with the socket here
        :
        :
     */
  }

<h2><a name="3" href="http://www.softlab.ntua.gr/facilities/documentation/unix/sockets.html#0">Dialing</a>
<br>(or:  How to call a socket)</h2>

You now know how to create a socket that will accept incoming calls.
So how do you call it?  As with the telephone, you must first have the
phone before using it to call.  You use the socket() function to do
this, exactly as you establish a socket to listen to.
<p>
After getting a socket to make the call with, and giving it an
address, you use the <a href="http://www.softlab.ntua.gr/cgi-bin/man-cgi?connect+2"><b>connect()</b></a> function to try to connect to a
listening socket.  The following function calls a particular port
number on a particular host:
</p><p>
</p><listing>  int call_socket(hostname, portnum)
  char *hostname;
  { struct sockaddr_in sa;
    struct hostent     *hp;
    int a, s;

    if ((hp= gethostbyname(hostname)) == NULL) { /* do we know the host's */
      errno= ECONNREFUSED;                       /* address? */
      return(-1);                                /* no */
    }

    bzero(&amp;sa,sizeof(sa));
    bcopy(hp-&gt;h_addr,(char *)&amp;sa.sin_addr,hp-&gt;h_length); /* set address */
    sa.sin_family= hp-&gt;h_addrtype;
    sa.sin_port= htons((u_short)portnum);

    if ((s= socket(hp-&gt;h_addrtype,SOCK_STREAM,0)) &lt; 0)   /* get socket */
      return(-1);
    if (connect(s,&amp;sa,sizeof sa) &lt; 0) {                  /* connect */
      close(s);
      return(-1);
    }
    return(s);
  }
</listing>
<p>
This  function  returns a connected socket through which data can
flow.

<h2><a name="4" href="http://www.softlab.ntua.gr/facilities/documentation/unix/sockets.html#0">Conversation</a>
<br>(or:  How to talk between sockets)</h2>

Now that you have a connection between sockets you want  to  send
data  between them.  The <a href="http://www.softlab.ntua.gr/cgi-bin/man-cgi?read+2"><b>read()</b></a> and <a href="http://www.softlab.ntua.gr/cgi-bin/man-cgi?write+2"><b>write()</b></a> functions are used to
do this, just as they are for normal files.  There  is  only  one
major  difference  between  socket  reading  and writing and file
reading and writing:  you don't usually get back the same  number
of  characters  that you asked for, so you usually loop until you
have read the number of characters that you want.  A simple function
to read a given number of characters into a buffer is:
<p>
</p><listing>  int read_data(s,buf,n)
  int  s;                /* connected socket */
  char *buf;             /* pointer to the buffer */
  int  n;                /* number of characters (bytes) we want */
  { int bcount,          /* counts bytes read */
        br;              /* bytes read this pass */

    bcount= 0;
    br= 0;
    while (bcount &lt; n) {             /* loop until full buffer */
      if ((br= read(s,buf,n-bcount)) &gt; 0) {
        bcount += br;                /* increment byte counter */
        buf += br;                   /* move buffer ptr for next read */
      }
      if (br &lt; 0)                    /* signal an error to the caller */
        return(-1);
    }
    return(bcount);
  }
</listing>
<p>
A  very  similar  function should be used to write data; we leave
that function as an exercise to the reader.
</p><p>
</p><hr>


<h2><a name="5" href="http://www.softlab.ntua.gr/facilities/documentation/unix/sockets.html#0">Hanging Up</a>
<br>(or:  What to do when you're done with a socket)</h2>

Just as you hang up when you're through speaking to someone  over
the  telephone,  so  must you close a connection between sockets.
The normal <a href="http://www.softlab.ntua.gr/cgi-bin/man-cgi?close+2"><b>close()</b></a> function is used to close each end of a socket
connection.  If one end of a socket is closed and the other tries
to write to its end, the write will return an error.
<p>
</p><hr>


<h2><a name="6" href="http://www.softlab.ntua.gr/facilities/documentation/unix/sockets.html#0">Speaking The Language</a>
<br>(or:  Byte order is important)</h2>

Now that you can talk between machines, you have  to  be  careful
what  you  say.   Many  machines  use differing dialects, such as
ASCII versus (yech) EBCDIC.  More commonly there  are  byte-order
problems.  Unless you always pass text, you'll run up against the
byte-order problem.  Luckily people have already figured out what
to do about it.
<p>
Once  upon a time in the dark ages someone decided which byte order
was "right".  Now there exist functions that convert  one  to
the  other  if  necessary.   Some  of these functions are <a href="http://www.softlab.ntua.gr/cgi-bin/man-cgi?htons+3"><b>htons()</b></a>
(host to network short integer), <a href="http://www.softlab.ntua.gr/cgi-bin/man-cgi?ntohs+3"><b>ntohs()</b></a> (network to  host  short
integer),  <a href="http://www.softlab.ntua.gr/cgi-bin/man-cgi?htoni+3"><b>htoni()</b></a> (host to network integer),
<a href="http://www.softlab.ntua.gr/cgi-bin/man-cgi?ntohi+3"><b>ntohi()</b></a> (network to
host integer),  <a href="http://www.softlab.ntua.gr/cgi-bin/man-cgi?htonl+3"><b>htonl()</b></a>  (host  to  network  long  integer),  and
<a href="http://www.softlab.ntua.gr/cgi-bin/man-cgi?ntohl+3"><b>ntohl()</b></a>  (network to host long integer).  Before sending an integer 
hrough a socket,  you  should  first  massage  it  with  the
htoni() function:
</p><p>
</p><listing>  i= htoni(i);
  write_data(s, &amp;i, sizeof(i));
</listing>

and after reading data you should convert it back with ntohi():

<listing>  read_data(s, &amp;i, sizeof(i));
  i= ntohi(i);
</listing>

If  you keep in the habit of using these functions you'll be less
likely to goof it up in those circumstances where  it  is  necessary.

</p><h2><a name="7" href="http://www.softlab.ntua.gr/facilities/documentation/unix/sockets.html#0">The Future Is In Your Hands</a>
<br>(or:  What to do now)</h2>

Using just what's been discussed here you should be able to build
your own programs that communicate with sockets.  As with all new
things,  however,  it  would be a good idea to look at what's already
been done.  Many public domain programs  exist  which  make
use  of  the  socket  concept, and many books exist which go into
much more depth than I have here.  In addition I've  deliberately
left  out  a  lot  of details such as what kinds of things can go
wrong; the manual pages for each of the functions should be  consulted
for this information.
